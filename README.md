<b>Lore</b>


Eggman's well-known enemy has always been Sonic, but after a while, and as of late, Shadow began intervening a lot, and that inconvenienced him more than he could admit it out loud. The dark hedgehog was slowly but surely becoming an annoyance for Eggman and he needed a solution quickly. So, he began working on something, something that would put an end to that stinky, bothersome hedgehog once and for all… Not in a gentle manner though. 

Somehow, he got his hands on Shadow's original blueprints and, utilizing them to create his own, he began engineering something powerful, something fueled off of rage and with a breath of fire. And like that, after being some years in stasis (15 specifically), Crimson was born.

Eggman began training her roughly, giving her no breaks or chances to catch her breath, wanting to make her the best warrior posible, almost as good as machines were, not taking into accound that a fully organic being couldn't work the same as the likes of a machine. And as the years passed, she grew up, and became stronger, getting ready to finally take down Shadow. Crimson is now 20.

The day arrived, and Crimson was released into the world to hunt down Shadow and end him, but Eggman didn't take into account that she would struggle navigating through the world since Crimson had never seen it at all, so Crimson was already at a disadvantage. After hours of tracking, she finally found herself with the ebony hedgehog, slowly approaching and lurking through the darkness. But as son as the battle began, fire and chaos energy meeting, Crimson was once again at a disadvantage. Shadow was much stronger and smarter, warping around and confusing her, and sooner than later, Crimson had to flee, scurrying back into Eggman's base for security. Months passed, and Crimson's attempts at ending Shadow were always a failiure, and Eggman was getting tired. Too tired. To the point that, when she failed a last time, he decided to get rid of her.

After a failed battle, Eggman confronted Crimson, telling her he didn't need her anymore and kicking her out of his team. He abandoned her in the middle of a forest to her own luck, with nothing but herself to rely on. Which again, was not much since she didn't know anything about the world outside Eggman's base. Without anything else to do, thinking she was doomed, she wandered through the woods without a purpose in mind until she found herself with none other than Rouge herself. The bat landed near her, wondering what she was doing there without Eggman around and looking so saddened. She explained her situation to Rouge, who decided to invite her to join team dark under the condition of not attempting to kill Shadow in an attempt to be accepted back by Eggman, Crimson accepted.

Shadow was... Not pleased. But he accepted the deal as well. Some days passed and Shadow realized Crimson was actually really peaceful and calm towards him, which made him slowly begin approaching her and spending time with her without much interaction happening. Eventually, and realizing Crimson spent most of her time inside the base, Shadow decided to take Crimson outside and show her the world, teach her about it and let her find her favourite things about it. It was odd, usually he found himself wanting to be far away from people and avoiding them, but with her, he found himself wanting to teach her and guide her through the world... Almost like how Maria had done with him. So he did, and slowly they began discovering things together, and slowly... They became closer. And with that, feelings began blossoming.

Both began to realize their friendship was beginning to blossom into something more. At first, they tried to deny it, to avoid it and bury it in their chests, but eventually, they couldn't hide it anymore and they decided to start a story together, one of joy and love where the two of them would slowly, but surely, build a future together, bringing each other that small part they got missing for so long ago.


<b>Facts</b>

✪ Even if Eggman used Shadow's blueprints to build Crimson's, they are not related in any shape or form. She also lacks the Black Arms/Alien DNA.

✪ Crimson can fully envelop herself in fire. This means her whole body.

✪ Even after Crimson's quills fall off, these continue being flammable and won't get damaged by fire, only by normal use such as being rubbed against a surface to be lit up.

✪ Crimson's preffered method of attack is spinballing while enveloped in fire. As well as punching while keeping fire around her fists.

✪ Her fur is silvery, meaning it shimmers against light sources.

✪ She loves stargazing alongside with Shadow.

✪ In the future of my AU, Crimson and Shadow will find an abandoned hedgehog runt in a carboard box whom they'll adopt and name Kiro.

✪ Crimson LOVES cranberries and apple cider.
